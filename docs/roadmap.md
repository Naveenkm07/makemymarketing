# Digital Display Advertising Platform - Project Roadmap

## Phase 1 – Research & Validation (Weeks 1–4)
- **Conduct deep market and user research.** Interview potential advertisers (brands, agencies, government departments) and screen owners (mall operators, billboard owners, cinema chains) in Bengaluru to map pain points and requirements.
- **Perform competitive analysis** of existing DOOH networks and signage platforms.
- **Analyze regulations** (Karnataka Outdoor Advertising Rules).
- **Evaluate technology feasibility** (e.g. IoT connectivity for screens).
- **Identify target customer personas and use cases** (e.g. a mall wants to sell ad slots on its screens; an SMB wants to run a short ad campaign).
- **Define the core value proposition and hypotheses** (e.g. users will pay for flexible ad bookings).
- **Plan initial metrics** (user signups, bookings volume).

## Phase 2 – Planning & Design (Weeks 5–8)
- **Define the MVP scope** and product roadmap. Split features into “must-have” and “nice-to-have”.
- **Specify non-functional requirements** (performance, uptime, security).
- **Choose architecture** (likely multi-tenant cloud); decide tech stack and deployment (e.g. AWS vs. Azure).
- **Draft data models and an initial database schema**.
- **Sketch UX/UI wireframes** for advertiser and owner portals.
- **Plan payment/billing integration**.
- **Estimate resources**, team roles, budget, and set a development timeline with milestones.

## Phase 3 – MVP Development (Weeks 9–20)
- **Implement core features in agile sprints** (2-4 weeks each).
- **Key tasks:** user authentication (role-based login for advertisers and owners), screen inventory module, booking engine, content upload, scheduling, and payment integration.
- **Build a basic web dashboard** for both user types.
- **Use continuous integration and automated testing**.
- **Begin simple analytics logging** (e.g. proof-of-play logs for ads).
- **Deploy to a staging environment**.

## Phase 4 – Testing & Pilot (Weeks 21–24)
- **Conduct QA, performance and security testing**.
- **Onboard a small pilot**: sign up 5–10 screen owners in Bengaluru (malls, transit shelters, cinemas) and 5–10 advertisers to run test campaigns.
- **Gather feedback** on usability and reliability.
- **Iterate quickly on issues** (bug fixes, UI tweaks, scheduling accuracy).

## Phase 5 – Launch & Initial Rollout (Weeks 25–32)
- **Publicly launch the platform in Bengaluru**.
- **Execute marketing** (Go-to-Market).
- **Provide user support and training materials**.
- **Monitor system health** (alerts, logs).
- **Collect metrics** (user acquisition, bookings, revenue).

## Phase 6 – Growth & Scaling (Months 9+)
- **Enhance features** (e.g. audience targeting, advanced analytics).
- **Optimize infrastructure for scalability** (auto-scaling, load balancers, caching).
- **Begin expanding beyond Bangalore** or to additional signage types.
- **Continuously collect user feedback** and iterate on product.
- **Agile/DevOps best practices**: modular/microservice architecture, CI/CD pipelines, feature flags, and strong security (OAuth2, encryption).
